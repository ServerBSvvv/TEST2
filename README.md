## Configure client
To connect to your server, you need a custom client. Here the only solution is to use a [pre-made client](http://download1644.mediafire.com/a1ut3eusl3ig/r6cph3wgimtvvqs/Brawl+Stars_24.142.apk). Just replace the IP in the frida-gadget config with yours (```/lib/armeabi-v7a/libgg.config.so```) ```{"interaction":{"interaction":{"type":"script","path":"libscript.so","on_change":"reload","parameters":{"redirectHost":"YOUR_IP"}}}```
